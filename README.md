# weechat-logexport

A weechat plugin providing buffer text export to external HTML file in a
specified location, providing nickname coloring and (hopefully) nice visual
result.

The part of the buffer text to export might be specified using the messages'
timestamps, or a part of the messages contents. It is also possible to export a
whole buffer. If you have something in mind which would be another great way to
select text chunks, please open an issue :)
